## AndroidFileHost Browser

## Use sparingly, as AFH now uses Cloudflare. Circumvention (which is what this app does) just means increasing load on their servers.

AFH Browser is an Android app that fetches a list of all files for a given device from AndroidFileHost.com.  
The list of files can be sorted by name or upload date, and a tap opens the AndroidFileHost page for that file, which can then be downloaded.
